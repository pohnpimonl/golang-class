# GO Module

## Introduction to Go Modules

Go Modules are the standard way to manage dependencies in the Go programming language since Go version 1.11. They
provide a built-in mechanism for versioning and package distribution, replacing the older GOPATH approach. Go Modules
enable you to define project-specific dependency requirements, making it easier to build reproducible and reliable
applications.

## Why Use Go Modules?

Before Go Modules, dependency management in Go was handled via the GOPATH environment variable, which had several
limitations:

- Global Namespace: All projects shared the same workspace, leading to potential version conflicts.
- Lack of Versioning: There was no native support for specifying or enforcing dependency versions.
- Reproducibility Issues: Builds could vary based on the state of the GOPATH, leading to inconsistent results.

Go Modules address these issues by:

- Allowing dependencies to be versioned.
- Enabling projects to be placed outside GOPATH.
- Ensuring reproducible builds by recording dependencies in go.mod and go.sum files.

Key Concepts

- Module: A collection of related Go packages with a go.mod file at its root.
- Module Path: The module’s import path declared in go.mod, e.g., github.com/username/projectname.
- Dependency: An external module that your module depends on.
- Semantic Versioning (SemVer): A versioning scheme that conveys meaning about the underlying changes.

----------------------------------------------

## Getting Started with Go Modules

1. Initializing a Module

To create a new module, navigate to your project directory and run:

```bash
go mod init [module-path]
```

Example:

```bash
go mod init github.com/yourusername/yourproject
```

This command creates a go.mod file, which declares the module path and records dependency requirements.

2. Adding Dependencies

When you import a package in your code and build or run your program, Go automatically adds the required module to your
go.mod file.

Alternatively, you can add a dependency manually:

```bash
go get example.com/some/module@v1.2.3
```

3. Updating Dependencies

To update an existing dependency to the latest version:

```bash
go get example.com/some/module@latest
```

Or to a specific version:

```bash
go get example.com/some/module@v1.3.0
```

4. Tidying Up

After adding or removing dependencies, it’s good practice to clean up your go.mod and go.sum files:

```bash
go mod tidy
```

This command:

- Adds missing module requirements.
- Removes unused dependencies.

Understanding go.mod and go.sum Files

- go.mod: Lists your module’s dependencies and their versions.
- sum: Contains cryptographic hashes of the dependencies, ensuring integrity.

----------------------------------------------
Common Go Module Commands

- go mod init [module-path]: Initialize a new module in the current directory.
- go mod tidy: Add missing and remove unused modules.
- go mod vendor: Populate the vendor directory with copies of packages needed to build and test.
- go list -m all: List all modules in your build.
- go get [module]: Add or update a module dependency.

----------------------------------------------
## Example

Step 1: Initialize the Module

```bash
go mod init github.com/golang-class/go-mod
```

Step 2: Write Some Code

Create a main.go file:

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"github.com/fatih/color"
)

func main() {
	color.Red("Hello, World!")
}
```
Step 3: Tidy Up

Ensure your go.mod and go.sum files are up-to-date:
```bash
go mod tidy
```

Step 4: Run the Program

```bash
go run main.go
```
